Hello carbon based unit! You reached a prototype of AbsImm, a simple, open, general purpose text adventure engine. I am sorry to have to tell you that I do not have stories available for you quite yet.\n
However, if you are interested in the project, and want to see it move forward, please /contact me or have a look at my /homepage.\n
Are you, by any chance, a /writer or /developer?\n
Please /contact me if you want to know more or want this project to kick off!\n
\n
Have a nice day, and thanks for stopping by!
